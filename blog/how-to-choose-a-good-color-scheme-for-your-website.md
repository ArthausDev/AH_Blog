title: How to Choose a Good Color Scheme For Your Website
content:
  - sectionHeading: ""
    sectionParagraphs:
      - paragraph: Choosing a good color scheme for your website could be a scary thing-
          especially if you’re not confident about your color coordination
          ability, or feel that you’re not a skilled designer.
      - paragraph: Picking and mixing color can be a tricky game.  The result can look
          harmonious, or like a scene straight out of a horror film!  If you
          avoid any colors, your website can look uninspiring and forgettable.
          If you use too much color on your website, you risk making it look
          tacky.
      - paragraph: If you are drawing a blank on what and how to use color on your
          website the right way, this post can help you.  Using color can be
          simplified once you know the right steps to take.
  - sectionHeading: 1. Choose your Dominant Color
    sectionParagraphs:
      - paragraph: The dominant color is your brand color – like the fire engine red for
          Coca-Cola.  This color will help bring out certain emotions or
          feelings when people arrive on your website – just like passion,
          excitement, boldness and love for Coke.  This is the color that you
          want your audience to remember when they think of you.  If you already
          have a logo, make sure one of the primary colors of your logo is using
          your dominant color
  - sectionHeading: 2. Choose your accent colors
    sectionParagraphs:
      - paragraph: To make your design more interesting (and professional), you need
          accent colors to highlight attention-worthy parts of your website like
          quotes, buttons or subtitles.  Color mixing and matching actually
          scare a lot of people because it’s not always easy or intuitive to
          tell which colors blend well together without a good understanding of
          color theory, and a lot of trial and error.
  - sectionHeading: " 3. Choose your website background color"
    sectionParagraphs:
      - paragraph: "If you have, then you will probably have some experience with
          picking a wall color – and you will know that choosing the right wall
          color can be a challenge.  You want the wall color to make the room to
          feel comfortable. The color should be soothing enough that you can
          spend hours in the room without having the color overwhelm you.  "
      - paragraph: At the same time, you don’t want the color to be so boring that the
          room feels completely sterile.  Choosing a background color is
          actually a lot like choosing a wall paint color!
