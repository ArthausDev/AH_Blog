        paragraph: Graphic design - the art of designing with graphics has changed
          radically in the last 40 years.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: As a young designer at the BBC in the early 80s it seemed that
          graphic design had changed very little from the 60’s. We were still
          drawing, painting and printing all the graphics that were shown on TV.
          From hand painting the horse racing results live on Grandstand with
          John McCririck shouting in one ear and a floor manager grabbing it
          before the paint had dried, to hot press printing, letter by letter
          the end credits roll for a sitcom.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: The same was so in the print world, where visuals were first drawn
          with magic markers and then everything would be typeset and images
          scaled and screened on a rostrum camera before it was all laid out as
          artwork on drawing boards using scalpels, hot wax, drafting pens and
          Letraset. This camera-ready artwork was then marked up and sent for
          film separations and then finally to proofs and print.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Graphic design was very labour intensive, it needed a wide range of
          skills and was very time consuming. Designers needed a lot of patience
          and dedication to develop a great design.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Zoom forward 40 years and in a blink of an eye with no real training
          this can be done by almost anyone with an ‘app’ - albeit often very
          badly.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Computers changed everything, allowing designers to use computer
          graphics in an effortless way, with a mouse or graphics tablet.
          Postscript language allowed designers to place type and graphics on
          the same page and send it straight to print.  With the coming of apps
          like Photoshop, and the Internet, a surge of new design disciplines
          also emerged. Web design, interactive design, UX/UI design, to name a
          few.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Behind all this change though the true purpose of graphic design ‘to
          communicate’ is the same as it has always been and the fundamental
          principles of design live on. Technology has helped speed up some of
          the processes, however the qualities of great graphic design are
          constant and still required a creative designer to be part of the
          process for the best results.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Concept Creation - all great design needs a solid concept behind it
          to succeed and whether it is done with a computer or pencil and paper
          the ‘big idea’ is key.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Visual Communication - the point of any graphic design is to
          communicate a message visually, be it on screen, on paper or on a
          wall. Great visual design should quickly convey, personality, tone,
          emotion as well as message. It’s fast - a ‘brain tattoo’.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Personality - no matter who you are, any graphic design you use —
          logos, websites, brochures etc. should be truly representative of who
          you are, reflecting personality & value. Personalised design that
          aligns with your company’s identity helps people - find you, remember
          you & differentiate you.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: User Experience (UX) - the one big change! - Up until recently
          graphic design was fundamentally a ‘one way’ experience. Technology
          has now made this a ‘multi way’ experience, with end users interacting
          and not just viewing.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: This has driven the development of UX design, which focuses on the
          entire experience a user has with a product or service, such as
          websites or apps. It combines, visuals, information architecture, user
          interface, interaction design and many others. Once again designers
          are wearing many ‘different hats’, with one of them being - graphic
          designer.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: In the last 40 years, technology has radically changed graphic
          design, however the core purpose and principals are still as relevant
          now as when man first used graphics on a cave wall - ‘to communicate’.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: As to where graphic design will go in the future though is anyone’s
          guess, but technological change will likely continue to have a big
          influence and the user experience is sure to remain at the forefront.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: At Arthaus our unique mix of graphic design communications expertise,
          original thinking and technology capability makes us an ideal partner
          to deliver great solutions and user experiences, through both

      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Experience counts.
