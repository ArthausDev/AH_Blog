        paragraph: I am a self-confessed brand enthusiast! The assembly of elements that
          create a living identity is a powerful thing. A strong brand
          foundation is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to creating
          visuals or crafting words that people engage with and build
          relationships upon.

        paragraph: ‘Brand’ and ‘Identity’ are often bandied about together, quite
          rightly, I firmly believe you cannot have one without the other. They
          must also be independently considered though, as they have quite
          different functions. The brand is the core structure of your
          business’s visual image, consisting of your logo, colour palette and
          the use of typography. The identity, on the other hand, is the
          feelings that are evoked by your company, the way a business talks, or
          sounds, it’s the lasting memory of the brand. You can see why
          combining them is so influential.

        paragraph: The best brands are created with one critical goal. Recognition. This
          is the key factor whether it’s in the mind of the consumer, an
          industry standard, or internal ethos. A well-developed strategy,
          unique design application and smart deployment of assets are the key
          ingredients to building a business identity that is both instantly
          recognisable and yet has longevity in peoples’ hearts and minds.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Brand consistency is imperative, whether that’s maintaining brand
          recognition or just starting your brand journey. Watered down
          application of a businesses’ key materials can send mixed messages and
          weaken a hard won impression. Never underestimate the significance of
          how the design of a brand is applied and how each element works
          together to singularly boast its voice.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: As you focus on business development and success, it is critical that
          the brand remains the beating heart of every new initiative, product
          and idea and doesn’t get damaged in the process.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: So, who better to look after that heart, than our experienced and
          infectiously enthusiastic team? Whether you are looking to create,
          evolve or protect this vital business asset, wear your heart on your
