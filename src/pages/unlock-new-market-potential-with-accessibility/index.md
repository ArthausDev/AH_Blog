        paragraph: Over the past few years, there has been a growing push to make
          websites more accessible. One of the big questions often asked is, why
          bother? “Surely the number of people with accessibility issues viewing
          my site is so small, it is just not worth the extra cost and effort to
          meet the accessibility standards?”
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Actually, the numbers are not so small. In the UK alone there are 12
          million people with disabilities, 7 million of those are in work, and
          their spending power to the UK economy is currently estimated at £250
          billion per year. Of those people, 75% are said to have turned away
          from businesses with poor accessibility or customer service, and 73%
          experience accessibility barriers on more than a quarter of the
          websites they visit. In 2016 alone UK consumer websites lost an
          estimated £11.75 billion from failing to provide the correct level of
          accessibility to its users.

        paragraph: I have ‘walked' away from sites due to my hearing loss. I often
          require 'closed captions' on videos to help me understand what is
          being said without the need to turn the volume up to 11 (which can be
          very annoying to those around me, as you might imagine). It is never a
          nice experience to be excluded and naturally creates negative
          opinions, which will likely spread as they tell others of their
          experiences.

          few small lines of CSS code updates the fails can easily be rectified
          making it more readable across the visible impairment spectrum."

        caption: "Example 2: Just by increasing the font-size to 16px+, selecting a font
          colour that passes contrast checks, increasing the line spacing to 1.5
          and ensuring that there is a maximum of 85 characters per  line, the
          user will instantly get a much more pleasant experience. This not only
          reads better but looks better too!"

        paragraph: In fact, accessibility practices don’t just help those with
          disabilities, they help everyone. We can all relate to browsing the
          web in bright or noisy environments, in glaring sunlight, or on slower
          connections. All of these issues can be countered with good
          accessibility practises, critically ensuring that you keep the traffic
          on your site and not turning to your competitors
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Making your website accessible, does not require a huge investment,
          it just requires accessibility to be integral to your design, starting
          with the wireframes and then throughout the design and development
          stages. Accessibility engagement at every stage throughout the
          process, is absolutely the key to success.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: As the internet becomes an integral part of our lives, the number of
          visitors to your site will increase and some will have accessibility
          requirements. In fact, for some users with disabilities well designed
          sites can be a lifeline. So now, more than ever, is the time to review
          your site and make sure it is open to all.

        paragraph: Here at Arthaus, we have been designing sites to the latest
          accessibility standards for many years. We have seen a real trend in
          our corporate clients focussing on accessibility throughout their
          business. The high standards of accessibility they set themselves for
          their customer facing sites also needs to be applied to their own
          internal sites. We are now working closely with them to develop
          strategies that ensure we enable them to meet these critical business
          goals.
