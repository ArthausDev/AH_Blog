        paragraph: Over the past few years, there has been a growing push to make
          websites more accessible. One of the big questions often asked is, why
          bother? “Surely the number of people with accessibility issues viewing
          my site is so small, it is just not worth the extra cost and effort to
          meet the accessibility standards?”
