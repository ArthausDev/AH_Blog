        paragraph: Much is written in business books and spoken in boardrooms about
          strategy. Put simply, strategy is an articulation of the direction and
          focus of a business. It certainly makes sense to have a plan of
          action, no matter what size your business or the nature of its work.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: What strategy does a small, professional services firm like Sea Glass
          have? And how might my experience help others?
  - sectionHeading: Strategy on the fly
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Sea Glass is 15 years old and I owe its survival and success to a
          strategy developed at speed and in the face of some scepticism.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Let me explain. A former colleague from Mullen in Boston was
          visiting London and we met for dinner. My American friend, George, was
          now on the board of advertising behemoth WPP and he didn’t completely
          approve of my small enterprise. George wasted no time enquiring
          earnestly about Sea Glass’s strategy. Quick as a flash and with some
          trepidation I revealed what was in my head: “Relentlessly stumbling
          around hoping to bump into something lucrative.”"
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: George said he liked it – particularly the sentiment of being
          relentless. Phew! The affirmation was a huge boost, and this simple,
          scribbled sentence has served me well ever since. (If writing for a
          client, the strategy would be less colloquial e.g., “Relentlessly
          applying my knowledge, expertise and experience to uncover lucrative
          opportunities.”
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "The strategy is about not standing still. Not being wedded to a
          static list of products and services. It is about responding to the
          marketplace, different situations, and the demands of customers. It is
          being open-minded and flexible enough to spot and implement change. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Perhaps it is easier for smaller companies to be scrappy and
          opportunistic? Although the modern trend for ‘fail fast’ would suggest
          otherwise. It’s also about being customer-centric. Let us also not
          forget one of the most overused words of lockdown – ‘pivot’. This Sea
          Glass strategy is all about the pivot.
  - sectionHeading: Tell them about the money, honey
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: The lucrative aspect of the strategy is also key. The goal is premium
          consulting and communications work that will stretch, deliver value
          and pay the bills. Many independent consultants charge worryingly low
          day rates and sell highly commoditised work. Isn’t this called a race
          to the bottom?
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "That does not mean everything is all about money. Sea Glass does
          regular pro bono work for charities – one notable project was with
          Arthaus on the rebranding of charity NurseAid. Sea Glass also recently
          wrote a website for the Down’s Syndrome charity, T-21. "
  - sectionHeading: "A restless quest "
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "In practical terms, Sea Glass has gone through three major pivots
          since 2006, with some considerable overlap between them and over £3m
          in consulting fees invoiced during this time. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Pitch Consultancy & Training: In the beginning, Sea Glass was almost
          solely dedicated to helping the CEOs of PR agencies win large new
          clients, thus enabling them to grow. Clients included 15 of the top-20
          UK PR firms and all the global networked agencies. It was a great
          success. As well as helping win dozens of big money pitches, Sea Glass
          trained hundreds of agency personnel.  Inevitably, there came a point
          when regular PR agency clients no longer needed outside assistance.
          Saturation point was reached, and this type of consulting work began
          to wane after 7-8 years. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "PR Agency Services: Out of the blue, a PR agency client asked Sea
          Glass to run a piece of retained business which did not fit its
          portfolio. This kicked-off a 3-5 year move towards delivering classic
          media relations and content, messaging, branding, etc. Retained
          clients included i20 Water, Gallup Consulting, Comparethemarket and
          Simpson Spence Young (an Arthaus client too), plus a huge number of
          projects.  This phase of Sea Glass was interesting and busy – it
          provided the reassurance of retainers, although margins were eroded by
          pricey freelance support. It’s also a highly competitive space."
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Event Facilitation: This was opportunism and luck. In 2014, a London
          PR agency asked Sea Glass to host and facilitate a journalist
          roundtable for its client, Sky. This mushroomed into more event-based
          hosting and facilitation. Today, Sea Glass works for almost all the
          global b2b technology brands and has hosted more than 250 roundtable
          events all over the world. Facilitation represents more than 70 per
          cent of Sea Glass’s current revenue. During lockdown, events have
          moved online and show no signs of slowing down. "
  - sectionHeading: Creating the right culture
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Having three different offerings in 15 years may not seem remarkable.
          However, it’s been a natural transition and without too much pain.
          Several of my independent consultant friends have been slow to respond
          to a changing marketplace, have a narrow offering, and lack a good
          network. I have also learned that, often, other people have more
          belief in you (and what you can do) than you have in yourself!
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "It is also crucial to have the right attitude to managing pressure
          and responding to situations. Changing tack is not a weakness.
          Business is never definite. It's very complex and ever-changing.  As
          boxer Mike Tyson once said: “Everybody has a plan till they get
          punched in the face”. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: In closing, I am reminded of the famous quote from Peter Drucker –
          “Culture eats strategy for breakfast”. Culture is the environment in
          which a strategy lives and, ultimately, the people bringing it to life
          are the ones responsible for its success or its demise. When I think
          back to my early conversations with George (my advertising friend) I
          was speaking to him as much about culture as strategy. The two go hand
          in hand.
