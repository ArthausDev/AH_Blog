As we settle into hybrid working and with the large majority of our communications taking place over Teams, we are migrating to a full Microsoft solution. 

As part of this process our telephone number is changing to 01491 913867 

This number now reflects our location in the heart of Henley where we have been since 2011. Until now our number had been ported from our previous office in Marlow, with its area code. 

Nothing else will change, not our emails, not our team, nor our commitment to our clients and to delivering outstanding design solutions. 

This change simply reflects Arthaus understanding and adapting to the changing environment and utilising technology to our best advantage. 

Why not give us a call on our new number, even if itâ€™s just to say hello to old friends.
