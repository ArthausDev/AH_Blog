        paragraph: Design is just as important for communicating with your employees as
          it is for your customers, digitally or in print.  Ensuring your
          message does not get lost in translation is crucial and design is the
          cornerstone of successful comms. Comms are about painting a picture
          and telling a story and design brings that story to life.

  - sectionHeading: 1.	It’s all about the Brand!
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Brand is the heart of everything, it brings recognition and is
          integral to your core values. The brand must shine through, it is the
          voice and tone of your business. Strong brands create belonging and
          loyalty.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Brand must be visible in every message. Even when there is a theme
          to the comms, the overall look and feel must reflect how you portray
          your brand on other channels and media, making the message truly your
          own. "

  - sectionHeading: 2.	It’s about making a Connection
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Good design creates emotional connections with your subject matter
          and your employees. Imagine a text heavy graph or a process timeline
          that uses just black and grey, no images (stay with me!), and you are
          asking your employees to read it and take it on board, trust me - they
          won’t!
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Now consider an infographic in your brand colours, with icons,
          colourful diagrams, and the crucial parts highlighted. The information
          will be the same but the employee take away from the learning will be
          far greater. Even just a scan read of the material will instantly
          convey the important information.

  - sectionHeading: 3.	It’s about that First Impression
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: In this digital age, you have only a few seconds to grab the
          attention of any audience. A well-designed landing page or cover image
          is very powerful. This first impression has the ability to draw them
          in and get them engaged, excited, and focussed.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Employees will always read something that this is compulsory but
          getting buy in, requires another level of interaction and the first
          impression is where it all begins.

  - sectionHeading: "4.\tIt’s about Stickability "
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Adding vibrancy and variety to your internal comms can make them
          infinitely more powerful, and much more likely to stick. Grabbing the
          attention of employees – wrapped up in their hectic schedules with
          little time to lend to taking in content – can be a tough nut to
          crack.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Design elevates even the most mundane content, to take it from just
          another task to an engaging task. Stickability adds a sense of purpose
          and design enables the message to resonate, be understood and be
          absorbed.

  - sectionHeading: 5.	It’s about the Journey
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Great design goes way beyond the way a message looks, it is also
          about the journey, negating frustration and user disengagement. How
          easy is an article is to read? How intuitive is the site or tool kit
          navigation? Where is the key information placed?
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Think about how the information will be used. For example – in an
          interactive PDF, will the user be reading it like a book or flipping
          back and forth between the content and an Appendix for example.  "

  - sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: In the last year employee communications have had to adjust
          dramatically, requiring employees more and more to digest information
          remotely. So, rise to the challenge, be creative and deliver materials
          that convey the message and stimulate the reader.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Great design, delivers great results!
