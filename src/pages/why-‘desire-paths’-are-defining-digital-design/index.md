      - paragraph: "When thinking about design it is often the purely visual aspect that
          is the client’s focus, simply asking us to create something that is
          visually appealing.  The brief hasn’t asked us to consider the end
          user experience or the interaction the audience will have. However, as
          designers, we must consider this to be one of the most compelling
          areas to focus on because the majority of people will remember an
          actual experience over something visual.  Our design should not
          challenge learned behaviours as this results in a loss of interest, or
          worse, a loss in purchase. "
      - paragraph: "To illustrate this point, a great example found in our everyday
          lives is to consider the experience whilst walking in parks or older
          planned towns. We start by following a defined path only to then find
          an informal path that either deviates or seems to suddenly appear
          without prompt of a planned pathway. These unplanned paths have been
          created over time due to the walker wanting a shorter route to their
          destination. These are perfect examples of how the pathways were
          planned with a primary focus on the aesthetics within their
          environment, rather than how their users would want to interact with
          them.  As a result of such a common and increasing occurrence of this
          phenomenon it has actually garnered a name: a ‘Desire Path’. "
      - paragraph: "The desire path is formed when a user deviates from the planned
          design, with either good or bad intention, but with intention all the
          same. Theoretically, the design may make sense to the creators,
          however in practice, the design will continue to fall short for the
          user – but why? Human nature, of course. "
      - paragraph: "Most users share the same driver for deviation:
          inconvenience.  Whether it be the inconvenience of time or effort it
          is the driving force behind the way they interact with the
          design.  This driving force of user experience leads us to ask the
          question: “so how do we design for this then?”. The answer is simply
          to follow the path of least resistance.  Design is not subjective or
          partial to a brand’s specific area of business, but rather, it
          transcends all such areas."
      - paragraph: "Inertia is the biggest threat!  Too many clicks, or needing to look
          for the next button, is all it takes for people to abandon the
          interaction.  To counter this designers should be looking to ‘pave the
          cowpaths*’. By doing this we will enhance what users are already doing
          and ensures that we support the most common desire paths.   "
      - paragraph: "We cannot always accurately predict a user’s behaviour but once we
          view the behaviour, good or bad, we should immediately action any
          shortfall and change the design for a better user experience.  Always
          remember if you have a direct competitor whose site is easy to use,
          the likelihood is they will go and use that site! "
      - paragraph: "Neil Sheppard, an experienced UX content strategist, advises “If
          there is one founding principle of user experience, it’s that your
          site should follow the user’s path, rather than directing them where
          you want to go.”. "
      - paragraph: "* In UX terminology a desire path is sometimes also referred to as a
          cowpath "
