        paragraph: "Marketing is crucial to the success of every business, and never
          more so, than in difficult economic times.  Digital marketing has for
          some time, been a fundamental strand of any good strategy.  In fact,
          it has now grown in efficacy, that we no longer really distinguish
          between digital and traditional marketing, it is all just
          marketing!  There are very few businesses who do not operate in some
          shape or form within the digital world.  "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: The options are vast and continually increasing in the digital arena
          and choice is always great. The amazing thing about digital marketing
          is it accessible to every business on every budget.  However, for
          results, it is critical to select the right platform and strategy for
          your business!
  - sectionHeading: So where do you start?
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Firstly, and most importantly what exactly are you trying to
          achieve?  We all want to sell more, but your objective needs to be
          specific - Are you trying to increase your online conversion rate?
          Drive customers to your shop?  Or develop your brand? "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Secondly, who are you trying to talk to?  It is vital to understand
          your audience.  The days of postcode, age and gender are gone.  You
          need to really understand your audience.  What do they like? Where do
          they hang out (digitally and physically)? Who are they ‘friends’ with?
          Who do they admire? What line of work are they in? This is called
          their ‘Persona’.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: A complete understanding of our customers and potential customers
          journey is required to develop a plan, that talks to them in the
          correct tone, at the correct time and with the most appropriate
          method.  This is crucial for every business no matter what size they
          are.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "This vital preparation will ensure your marketing initiatives will
          work as hard as possible for you.  Niche targeting and identifying the
          right digital method for you, will also, most importantly, ensure your
          budget is not wasted and your conversions are high. "

    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: So, with clear objectives and ‘Personas’ you can start to formulate
          your marketing.  Here is a brief rundown of digital marketing methods
          with their pros and cons, for the development of a robust and
          successful digital marketing strategy.
  - sectionHeading: Websites
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Websites are your shop window, even if you are not an ecommerce
          site!  It is a brochure to promote your brand and business, what you
          sell and what services you offer.  Websites are a powerful tool for
          lead generation, remarketing and vital for being seen on google with
          effective Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). Do not assume if you are
          not selling online you do not need a website. Most importantly, do not
          assume if you have a website you will be seen, you need to tell people
          it is there.
  - sectionHeading: Social Media
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: This has become an incredibly powerful tool over the past few years
          for businesses around the world.  Currently in the UK Facebook alone
          has over 44 Million users.  Can you imagine being able to target 44
          Million users with budgets as small as £100 a month?  There are no TV
          channels or Magazines with that reach, and you would need much deeper
          pockets.
  - sectionHeading: Facebook
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "People use Facebook to stay connected, to discover what is going on
          in the world, and to share and express what matters to them.  This is
          an extremely powerful tool for B2C marketing and extremely cost
          effective. "
  - sectionHeading: Instagram
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Instagram is a photo sharing app which allows users to assign filters
          to photos and share them with followers.  With more than 25 million
          businesses are actively using Instagram, to market to their audience
          as millions of consumers use it to shop.  The visual content is
          extremely appealing and helps consumers with the buying decision.  The
          growing Instagram network helps brands and retailers leverage visuals
          to better describe and detail their products.  It is part of the
          Facebook network and advertising on Instagram is also inexpensive.
  - sectionHeading: Twitter
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Tweets can be a great lead generation or brand awareness
          tactic.  The con is that the tweets are very short so you have to be
          concise with your message but it is pretty cost effective to advertise
          on Twitter and it works well for both B2B and B2C audiences. "
  - sectionHeading: LinkedIn
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: This is the number one platform for B2B marketing.  There are
          currently 630 million professionals on LinkedIn, and you can reach all
          of them or drill down to create your perfect niche target
          audience.   You can use this free platform to organically grow your
          network by creating stimulating and relevant posts or you can create
          and post adverts to generate new business leads.  The con is the extra
          functionality on the platform is relatively expensive compared to the
          other social channels, however, the price is justified due to the
          quality audience available to you.
  - sectionHeading: Email Marketing
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Email Marketing is not dead, it is most definitely
          alive!  Businesses can improve their reach and visibility, allowing
          them to engage and convert more leads on a consistent basis by
          creating a regular email flow.  Targeting can be niche and best of all
          most systems are free below a certain audience volume. "
  - sectionHeading: Measurement is a Must!
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "So, you have picked your platform or combination of platforms now
          you need to make sure it is working for you.   I love the analytics
          capability digital platforms provide, real time results from your
          marketing campaign - how many people have seen it, clicked on it,
          opened it, or bought from it at your fingertips.  This ensures you can
          manage what is working and what is not. "
  - sectionHeading: Conversion
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Ensure your investment is not wasted by creating suitable landing
          pages to optimise the conversion rates.  Understand your customers
          journey to you and serve them the content they are expecting.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "The digital marketing landscape is forever changing, if you would
          like more information on what the best platform for your business is

          digital solutions to achieve your business objectives. "
