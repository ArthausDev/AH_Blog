        paragraph: Accessibility is not a ‘nice to have’, it’s key to your culture and
          ethos and it formulates the way the business is perceived both
          internally and externally. Whether you are a site owner, designers, or
          developers we should not be looking to shoe-horn in quick fixes.
          Getting it right not only meets the needs of so many people, but also
          has the power to make their day to day lives a little bit easier.
          Every brand strives to deliver simplicity.

        paragraph: Page headings inform the user what they can expect to find on the
          page but by adding sub-headings to the content you help to break up
          the page, add interest and improve navigation for everyone,
          particularly for those using assistive technologies.

        paragraph: Adding sub-headings will be a small change but by doing so you will
          make your site more accessible for anyone unable to navigate webpages
          using a mouse. Working only with the keyboard, users can jump focus
          from heading to heading, and screen readers can bring up a list of
          headings and sub-headings that allow the user to quickly jump to the
          content they need.

          experience.
