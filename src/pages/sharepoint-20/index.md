      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: SharePoint is now 20 years old, and, like a fine wine, it just keeps
          improving with age.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "We have been working with SharePoint from its infancy, through its
          various growth spurts, teenage years and now continuing into the young
          adulthood of SharePoint Online. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "So, we wanted to share our years of experience of designing,
          developing and tweaking  SharePoint systems by passing on our top tips
          for engagement and ROI when using SharePoint platforms.   "
  - sectionHeading: "1. Encapsulate your brand "
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Your intranet and shared workspaces should be extensions of your
          business and this requires so much more than just your company colours
          and logo! "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Revamping and skinning SharePoint is a great way to ensure the
          platform represents your company culture. Shoehorning your branding
          into the default or out of the box (OOTB) themes is unlikely to truly
          deliver. Customising layouts, navigation, buttons, lists, images,
          animations, text and fonts will ensure you genuinely encapsulate your
          brand, bringing your most valuable content sharing tool in line with
          your company’s vision.  "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "This can only serve to strengthen the connection with all your
          users. "

  - sectionHeading: "2. Personalise it   "
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "SharePoint is a powerful information sharing tool and an excellent
          document repository for the entire organisation. You can create
          sections for departments, countries, territories, policies, etc. … the
          list is endless. Setting up important document libraries and creating
          pages with good metadata will provide the cornerstone for SharePoint
          Searching. Doing this correctly you will harness the power of the
          inbuilt search, delivering excellent results.  "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Promoting good use of SharePoint user profiles and ensuring your
          company’s Active Directory is up to date is an absolute must for the
          best results. Adding in information like the user’s department,
          location, region, or even areas of professional interests allow you to
          target information and news stories directly to those users.  "

  - sectionHeading: "3. From A to Z "
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "SharePoint OOTB navigation is not perfect. Top navigations, site
          navigation and the mega menus are mainstays within the SharePoint
          world. However, newer customised solutions can open a lot more
          opportunities to meet your business needs. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Personalised toolboxes and quick links can be present on all site
          home pages, allowing the users to record their favourite places
          (pages/items/links?) easily. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Customised, targeted audience navigation allows the dynamic
          show/hide of links based on user access permissions or interests.
          Although rarely used in most setups it can be effective in creating an
          easier approach to navigating around larger intranets. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: With the power that SharePoint offers it means that there are many
          different options that can be explored for small, medium, and
          enterprise level navigation systems.

  - sectionHeading: "4. Everybody is a content editor "
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "SharePoint is embracing the ‘Everybody is a content editor’ outlook
          for the application. Gone are the days when you needed to know html,
          JavaScript and .NET programming languages to be able to create new
          pages or add in extra customised functionality. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "This brings an opportunity for your teams to bring your site to
          life, keep it current, engaging and delivering value.   "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Webparts range in size and complexity but can be visually stunning
          for each version of SharePoint. Investing in these customised
          solutions will transform the user experience. "

  - sectionHeading: "5. Content is king "
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "News fills our lives. The value is in being able to cut through the
          noise to see only what is useful for you and your business. RSS feeds
          can provide the solution. SharePoint provides OOTB as well as more
          customised connections to display inside your intranet. The content
          avenues are numerous, creating a custom solution for your users. In
          our experience we have found that the some of the most popular feeds
          are: localised weather forecast for regional offices; the latest
          company social media feeds; important sports directories; and news –
          both business and employee. "

        paragraph: "If you are looking to make your Intranet really work for your
          business, or have a business specific need, customisation is the
          answer. Whether it is easy to edit webparts or list-based editing to
          control multiple elements in your system we have the knowledge and
          experience to help you get the most out of your SharePoint System.  "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: We can help you set up new content management options, build webparts
          or help you right at the beginning of your journey. We can scope,
          design, and build your entire SharePoint system for you. Forethought
          and experience are key for a successful user focused intranet setup.
