As a creative agency, this is a question we have looked at in detail, but in fact, our experience shows that creative projects need structure and framework just like any other and here is why. 

The three fundamental goals of a project are costs, time, and scope.  Design project goals are no different. In fact, any project that involves creativity, is going to take some time to conceive and develop and therefore the risk to the project goals could be greater.  Bringing a visual concept to life is different, regular client interaction in project meetings ensures that revisions can be made as the design progresses and limits the opportunities for the project to spiral out of control. 

We have a talented team of designers and developers who work within our tried and tested project frameworks, but they still need the guidance of an assigned project manager.  The PM’s initial role is to ensure the team totally understands the client’s brief.  Clearly identifying the project goals, ensuring the parameters are well-defined and that any brand guidelines are adhered to. 

A project schedule is then created and shared with the wider team and of course the client (buy in and sign off from the client are crucial) as there are often windows within the project that contain client actions, without which completion of the project stalls costing time and money. Testing is a much underrated and often under resourced part of the project. It is important to include some people not too close to the project to bring a fresh look before sharing it to a wider audience. 

A precise schedule and its milestones are a visual overview of the project. Tasks and milestones need to be clearly identified so that project deliverables stand out, making it easy to check project status quickly – even when there are complex task dependencies involved. This also provides peace of mind for the client, particularly on larger projects where there may not be much to see until later in the project. 

Wireframes are the foundation for any web design projects, they enable the functionality, creative design and branding to be addressed together.  As part of the process, the team will of course, have considered [Desire Paths](https://blog.arthaus.co.uk/why-%E2%80%98desire-paths%E2%80%99-are-defining-digital-design/) and [Accessibility](https://blog.arthaus.co.uk/unlock-new-market-potential-with-accessibility/) within the creative brief.  The wireframes facilitate an early understanding for everyone of how products, services and business elements are categorized and connected.  Spending time at this stage will protect the costs, time, and scope goals.  

The PM liaises with the internal and external project team at all stages to identify any risks or delays and ensure that these are addressed in the project team meetings – even the best planned projects will inevitably encounter challenges, so addressing them quickly is imperative. 

For a PM scope creep is often their biggest enemy on any project. Although change is inevitable with a design project, ensuring it does not go too far must be a prime focus. If scope change is required, then the PM is responsible for getting the additional costs and schedule adjustments agreed. 

Organisation is the key to successful project management, that, and the support of a great team of people with different skills and talents, obviously. At Arthaus that organisation starts with a detailed, structured project plan which we create with your requirements and timeframes at the heart, but it will always be underpinned by our solid processes to ensure we deliver your project goals. 

In fact, project management is such a fundamental part of our agency that we ensure that all our projects, no matter how small, are run to the highest standard, on time and within budget. This commitment is backed by our accreditation to ISO9001 Quality Standard, where our processes are audited and certificated every year to ensure nothing slips through the net!
