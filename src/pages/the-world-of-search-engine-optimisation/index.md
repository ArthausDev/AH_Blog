        paragraph: "Search engine optimization is a valuable tool to most websites and
          businesses, it’s true.  However, do not let the search for SEO
          perfection compromise your website. Every change to major search
          engine algorithms sends shockwaves throughout the web, but if you
          tried to track every change and fathom out how to deliver the right
          content, you would need a huge team and deep pockets, just like
          Google. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Googles policy has always been clear about its position on providing
          meaningful content.  So, this is where your focus should be.  You
          should decide on the main purpose of your website.  Is it a brochure
          site for clients and prospects or an e-commerce site?  Your website is
          about engaging new and existing customers and therefore the content,
          accessibility and design are the areas you need to be focussing on.

        paragraph: It is also becoming more apparent that Google ranks brands and
          therefore wider brand and content marketing campaigns that link to
          your website are key to success not just for SEO but critically
          growing your business.

        paragraph: Metadata has come a long way since the early days of SEO. Meta titles
          and descriptions have always been important, but structured data is
          another essential piece to the puzzle and should not be ignored.  Once
          you have invested in great content do not waste it!
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Structured data helps make online data machine-readable, it allows
          you to label content which was not previously possible. This is how
          search engines display results like recipes, reviews, event details,
          and much more. This removes a lot of the guesswork from the crawling
          process, which makes it a whole lot easier to understand and index
          content for more specific searches.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Search engines like fast and accessible websites. They are much
          easier to crawl, and they are also easier for users to browse. No
          matter how good a site looks, if it takes a long time to load or is
          not easy to read, people will not want to navigate any further and may
          leave and use other websites to find what they were looking for.   We
          have discussed this further in our Accessibility blog.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "There are some easy steps to facilitate the increased speed of your
          site.  A common mistake, is the size of files being uploaded to the
          site, use small files when it comes to images.  Why upload 12MB images
          when 200KB versions deliver the same visual effect.  Images are the
          most popular resource type on the web though, so it is also important
          not to leave the image looking blurry and distorted. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: The other effect of increased mobile browsing is that Google has
          moved to a mobile-first indexing for all websites, which means mobile
          renders of a page are being indexed as opposed to the desktop page. If
          your website is perfect on desktop but a mess on mobile your SEO will
          suffer.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "It is vital to streamline your code and cut out unnecessary HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript.  There are a wide range of tools available to
          help.  For example, the Google PageSpeed Insights is one such tool we
          use to test sites that we create.  "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "It is a marathon, not a sprint. Implementing best practice can
          produce immediate results, but long-term performance requires
          long-term maintenance. The world of SEO is and always will be a
          changing landscape. Use this as a reminder to keep your site current,
          informative and engaging.  "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Success a multi-pronged attack, with design and technical factors
          both playing leading roles.  It is a complicated subject and one we
          could talk about in much more depth than this blog allows.  If you are
