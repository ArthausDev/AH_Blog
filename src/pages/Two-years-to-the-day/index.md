        paragraph: Two years to the day.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Wednesday 18 March 2020 pre-emptively we packed up the office and
          sent the team home with their computers to Work From Home for the
          foreseeable future. The following  Monday, 23 March 2020, Boris
          Johnson announced the first lockdown and we were told to ‘stay at
          home’ and work from home if we could. At the time everyone expected it
          to be just a few weeks, maybe a couple of months at most and then we’d
          all be back in the office and the world would be back to normal.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: As it was for many businesses, working from home was something
          completely new for Arthaus, something we had not previously explored.
          As a design team, we needed to be together, to share ideas and
          collaborate. How would it work for us? Could we make a success of it?
          Could we keep the business going? But we were not alone in asking
          these, and many other questions, and like all the other businesses we
          nervously set off on our journey to the find the ‘new normal’.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: A full two years later and we’ve finally made it back to the office
          as team. For many reasons it wasn’t right for us to go back before
          now. Over the two years we made plans to return a couple of times but
          on both occasions an increase in Covid cases changed the rules and put
          paid to those plans.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Now we are in March 2022 and here, back in the office as team with
          some familiar faces and some new colleagues who had not previously
          seen the office or worked in the same space as the rest of the team.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Where we originally expected returning to the office to be a simple
          return to how things were pre-pandemic, two years on we are looking at
          things very differently and this return will see many changes.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Looking around at how other businesses have approached their return,
          there doesn’t seem to be a ‘right way’ to set up the working week.
          We’re all in the dark as to what will work best for each business. It
          does appear that five days in the office is not what colleagues want
          and this seems to be the consensus among businesses too – though there
          are some that say it is the only way to be successful. But why do we
          need to make people travel to an office to do what they did
          effectively for so long from home? There is the argument that teams
          will collaborate more when they are together, but does that need to be
          every day? Time will tell and success will be the driver.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: For the Arthaus team, who maintained good collaboration by extensive
          use of Teams, we will start with one day a week to see how this works
          for us with an expectation that we will quickly add another day (or
          two).
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: For our clients, there should be no change in level of service that
          we provide but you may hear ‘buzz’ in the background if you call on a
          day when we’re in the office. And as we are in the office, why not pay
          us a visit. Come to Henley, meet the team and see our fabulous office
          by the river.
