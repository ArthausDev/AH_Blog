        paragraph: "A new year means a new chapter and the possibility of doing things a
          little better, especially when it comes to supporting your own
          performance and wellbeing. Your ability to be at your best mentally,
          physically and emotionally will positively impact your approach to
          business and how you develop your brand. It is with good intentions
          that we map out our narrative only for our stories to be interrupted
          or come to a complete halt. There are many resources offering insight
          on how to avoid your New Year goals being derailed including: being
          explicit, scalable, measurable and holding yourself accountable. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "How we think, feel and perform is relative to each individual. To
          this end, creating a framework to support your unique needs is
          important, especially since many of last year’s challenges will carry
          over to 2021. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: In this article we share tactics from our 6-week Proactive Thriving
          programme which we run for teams. Perhaps you identify with all of the
          below, but we’d like to encourage you to take action on one or two
          tactics that are most important to you.
  - sectionHeading: Anxiety
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "The uncertainty that has prevailed over the last few months has
          provided the ideal foundation for anxiety. Let’s face it – all of our
          anxiety dials have been turned up! The right amount of stress can be
          so helpful for getting things done – it’s when these levels overflow
          that this useful commodity becomes negative and is experienced as
          anxiety. Anxiety can be accompanied by many symptoms including
          behaviour, thoughts and physical. When you are in the thick of
          everyday life these signals easily go unnoticed. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Tactic: There is no tactile device on the market to measure anxiety
          and the best way to do this is through self-awareness. Recognising the
          unique signs your body gives you and catching this early enables you
          to take action. Could 2021 be the year when you fine-tune listening to
          your body?"
  - sectionHeading: Hybrid working
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Whilst many organisations have learned to embrace remote working in
          recent years, 2020 has truly been the year of working from home.
          Adapting to the sudden change has been overwhelming for many, but
          hopefully it has shown that you are much more resilient than you give
          yourself credit for. Whether you are working from home, on the move or
          in the office, it’s important to stay focused on your priorities. The
          challenge is that being overwhelmed, under pressure or overly stressed
          can make it harder to think and make decisions with a clear head. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Tactic: In order to be productive and perform at our best, we need
          to consider the internal and external factors that may distract,
          disrupt or disorganise our days. What are the top three factors that
          get in the way of a productive day for you? Becoming more self-aware
          is the first step in creating a plan to then combat these brain
          drainers."
  - sectionHeading: Positive Mental Health
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: There is certainly a lot of noise out there around poor mental
          health. Unfortunately, the pandemic has acted as a catalyst to our
          current Mental Health crisis. Depression was the leading cause of
          disability worldwide pre-Covid; statistics from the ONS (1) reveal
          that depression has doubled in the last year. There are many ways we
          can promote positive mental health for ourselves and these ways don’t
          need to be over complicated. In fact they tend to be very simple -
          take gratitude practice for example.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Tactic: There is a bank of research (2) to support how taking time
          out daily to acknowledge what you are grateful for has a profound
          positive impact. Writing this down daily could contribute to a year of
          positive emotions, improved relationships and good mental health.  "
  - sectionHeading: Boosting Vitality and Energy
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: As we start a new year, it’s the ideal time to reflect on your
          healthy habits and consider the ways in which you can energise your
          body and brain. 2020 may have taken a lot of of you emotionally,
          mentally and even physically (given the closure of gyms and fitness
          venues across the country for extended periods of time). For others,
          the year’s challenges have actually led to an increase in physical
          activity and healthier eating. For example, making homemade meals has
          become the more convenient (and often the only) option. As a result,
          it makes sense to make smart choices that support wellbeing and
          performance.
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Tactic: When doing your weekly food shop, one of the easiest ways to
          increase your nutrient intake is to ensure you select at least seven
          different vegetables and fruits that cover the colours of the rainbow.
          It sounds challenging but this is a simple way to get a broad variety
          of beneficial vitamins and minerals into your diet."
  - sectionHeading: Getting a Good Night’s Sleep
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Is sleep the barometer to your mood? Too little sleep can contribute
          to irritability, stress levels and your overall health. (3) What is
          interesting is humans are the only mammals to actively defy ourselves
          of sleep. The less we get the more evasive it seems to be! Experts do
          highlight the importance of quality over quantity. Working towards a
          few solid hours to support this industrious and restorative process is
          key. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Tactic: A positive step towards a good night’s sleep is putting a
          good bedtime routine in place. Consider getting your senses involved
          in this process. The likes of an aromatherapy bath, darkness, calm
          music or meditation and luxurious bedding creates a sleep conducive
          environment. The key to success is consistency – by repeatedly sending
          your brain the same message every evening means the physiological
          process is teed up automatically."
  - sectionHeading: Mindset and Motivation
    sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Being faced with constant change and uncertainty can be unnerving
          for most people, but the way in which you approach and think about
          life’s challenges is what really makes the difference. 2020 is
          evidence that life is full of uncontrollable factors, and so shifting
          the focus to things in your control is a powerful way to maintain
          resilience and even sanity. "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Tactic: Looking forward over your coming week or month, reflect on
          the activities and people who light you up versus those that bring you
          down and drain your energy. Take deliberate action to do more of what
          you enjoy and work on reducing or removing those other activities. It
          may be a gradual process but the more you can consciously adjust what
          you spend your time on, the more in control and more positive you will
          feel and be."
  - sectionParagraphs:
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "One final important step for your consideration. Small, consistent
          changes offer long term incremental gains. Whilst you may be inspired
          to take action on all of the above, start with one or two steps and
          commit to these wholly. Consistency is key if you want to be part of
          the 8% of the population (4) whose New Year intentions are successful.
          "
