      - paragraph: We have long been aware of the elephant in the room – the obvious
          problem that people don’t want to tackle – but now there’s another
          animal we need to deal with, the Hippo.  So, what is a Hippo and how
          do we deal with it?
      - paragraph: "Take your average 'brainstorming' meeting where no idea is a bad
          idea. We’re all there to contribute to the creative process, except we
          don’t.  At one time or another we have all sat uncomfortably in a
          meeting listening to one voice while the rest of us watch on in near
          silence, only speaking to agree with the leader. This one voice
          dominates the session, everyone else struggles to get their ideas
          heard.  A problem when in the same room, but we are now grappling with
          a whole new set of challenges for our creative meetings in the virtual
          world of MS Teams or Zoom. "
      - paragraph: "Lets’ start by looking at why we struggle with these meetings in the
          first place, it is an issue of information sharing, or lack of. When a
          leader has a domineering personality, it can shut down communications.
          People don’t say what they think, they say what they think the leader
          wants to hear – or simply don’t say anything. Avanash Kaushik, a tech
          entrepreneur, has coined the term Hippo: the highest-paid person’s
          opinion. He says: “Hippos rule their world, they overrule your ideas,
          they impose their opinions on the meeting, they think they know best
          (and sometimes they do), their mere presence in the meeting prevents
          ideas from coming up.”. "
      - paragraph: "Does this 'new normal’ in fact present a golden opportunity to build
          a safe environment for all attendees and flatten the social
          hierarchies. People feel less intimidated when leaders are not in the
          same room, it allows the introverts to find their voice and actively
          contribute to the session with ideas that might have gone unnoticed. "
      - paragraph: "The virtual world also reduces the significance of appearance. In a
          face to face meeting a range of factors can influence the group
          dynamics, including tone and physical attractiveness. Evidence shows
          that a deep voice and a posh accent, spoken by a tall, well-dressed
          male has a vastly more persuasive impact than a higher-pitched voice
          and regional accent, even if what is said is identical. In a virtual
          world substance is elevated above style. Leigh Thompson, of America’s
          Northwest University, says: “Physical charisma does not always
          translate in to ‘e-charisma’.”. "
      - paragraph: "Of course, in this new scenario we’re not all going to be winners.
          Anyone who relied on physical charisma to get their way may not fare
          so well. They may need to learn a whole new set of skills, new ways of
          persuading. Those not prepared to adapt and who assume the old ways
          will suffice,  may struggle.  "
      - paragraph: "So back to our Hippo, what can we do to mitigate their influence in
          a brainstorming session? Perhaps we should consider the pioneering way
          that Amazon run their internal meetings, they ensure that the 'leader
          speaks last'. This thwarts the classic dynamic of everyone converging
          on the leader’s perspective early on. It generates a freer, wiser
          discussion and works well in the online environment.  "
      - paragraph: "Another option to consider is a moderator, certainly for meetings
          with a larger group. They will be able to drive the discussion and
          manage the conversational turn-taking. This prevents people speaking
          over each other or struggling to be heard. We should also take
          advantage of the “raise hand” function to indicate we have a point to
          make.  "
      - paragraph: Whichever way you choose to tackle this new virtual world, what is
          clear is that we will all need to have an agile and flexible mindset
          as well as devoting time and energy to getting our virtual meeting
          protocols right. Those that do are infinitely more likely to win.  We
