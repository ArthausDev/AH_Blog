        paragraph: "The Prime Minister has laid out his plan, to bring us out of
          lockdown and with it brings change, yes, the changes many of us now
          long for and dream of, some normality in our lives, some consistency,
          but are we the people we once were? "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: The enforced work from home policy for most businesses is a total
          culture change, many roles were simply 100% office based and when
          people took the role, that is what they signed up for, they knew
          nothing else. However, now they do have a different way of doing
          things, do they still want, or need, the same things?
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Commuting was just an accepted part of peoples’ day, a necessary
          evil, but the lockdowns have shown people just how much time they
          spent travelling to and from their workplace and what other things
          they can be doing with that time.  Is that what they now want?
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Working from home for some brought anxiety and isolation, and for
          others brought time to breathe and think and spend more time with
          their children.  Will that be a moment in time they are happy to wave
          goodbye to, or a window to a better way of life?
    sectionHeading: "Do you have a strategic plan for the HR and internal
      communications challenges that we are about to face? "

        paragraph: This graphic has got so much traction on social media in the last
          couple of weeks, it shows a changing mindset, and it has been very
          well received.  However, when I considered it more carefully, I
          started to wonder if this really is representative of post pandemic
          workforces. If it is, what do we need to change to retain and recruit
          talent to our businesses?
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "When the pandemic hit, as businesses and employees we were all in
          the same boat and adapting to a sudden impact, there was a mutual
          understanding while we all navigated our way through.  However, the
          way we move forward now can, and should, be planned and how well we
          communicate the new landscape is going to be key to employee
          engagement, retention, and productivity.  So are you ready? "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: Brand perception is so critical today and the criteria on which it is
          judged is growing, the culture of a brand is becoming ever more the
          focus for the discerning customer of today.  Culture must change with
          the times, and this may be the most seismic shift in culture we have
          seen for decades.  We need to embrace it and make it work for our
          businesses and our employees and we need to do it now.  How can we
          ensure our message is being heard?
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: "Successes in life come from being first, leading from the
          front.  Leadership is all about communication and interaction, it’s no
          good having the best ideas if people do not hear, engage, and embrace
          them. What are you doing to make sure you are being heard? "
      - asteriskText: false
        paragraph: If you are looking for a forward-thinking design agency, who are
          passionate about making your brand and employee communications answer
          peoples questions, get in touch and let’s start a conversation.
